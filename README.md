# McBroken Net Loss Project

This project is designed for computing net loss of McDonald's 
restaurants in the USA due to broken ice-cream machines.
There are some assumptions made due to absense of information in free access,
all of them are listed in the script.

The formula for computing net loss is following

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bg{white}NetLoss&space;=&space;\frac{NumberOfHoursWithBrokenMachinesAmongAllRestaurants}{24}&space;\times&space;\frac{NumberOfVisitorsPerDayInTheUSA&space;\times&space;PercentageOfPeopleWhoOrderedDesert&space;\times&space;PercentageOfIceCreamAmongDeserts&space;\times&space;OneIceCreamNetIncome}{NumberOfRestaurantsInTheUSA})
